HTSH - The Haskell Tiny Shell

This is me scratching an itch I had. I wanted a to write
a relatively large Haskell program using libraries that
I have never used before.

The prompt uses the readline library to make it easier to
use this shell. Currently, none of the built in functions
(cd, echo) are not implemented, but I probably will implement
them at a later date.

You can do piping, redirection, and backgrounding as of right
now. Signal handling is currently a placeholder that prevents
you from stopping the shell. Use ctrl+D to exit the shell.
